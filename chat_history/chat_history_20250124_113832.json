    "message": "The blue color of the sky is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the gases and particles in the air. The shorter blue wavelengths of light are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\nThe reason blue light is scattered more than other colors is because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This scattering of blue light is more noticeable to us during the day when the sun is overhead, giving the sky its characteristic blue hue.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the sky appears blue because of how sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere, scattering blue light more effectively than other colors.",
