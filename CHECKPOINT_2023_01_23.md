## Current Working State
All system monitoring components are fully functional with proper formatting.

### Key Files and Their Status:

1. `src/core/chat_interface.py`:
   - Updated display_system_info method with proper formatting
   - All system monitoring buttons working
   - Clean separation of concerns for different types of system info

2. `src/services/system_service.py`:
   - All monitoring functions returning correct data structures
   - Functions: get_system_health, get_process_info, get_network_info, etc.

3. `src/services/chat_service.py`:
   - Updated to handle system queries properly
   - Removed emotional responses for system queries
   - Added direct system monitoring integration

### Working Components:

1. System Health Monitor:
   ```
   - CPU: usage and temperature
   - Memory: total, used, available (in GB)
   - Storage: per-disk usage and free space
   - Battery: level and status
   ```

2. Process Monitor:
   ```
   - Top 20 processes by CPU usage
   - PID, CPU%, RAM, process name
   - Aligned column format
   ```

3. Network Information:
   ```
   - Network interfaces with IP details
   - Active connections grouped by status
   - Clear hierarchical display
   ```

4. Device Information:
   ```
   - USB devices with status
   - Disk drives with size
   - Network adapters with MAC
   - Monitor information
   ```

5. Environment Information:
   ```

   - System information
   - Environment variables
   ```

### Known Working State:
- All system monitoring buttons functional
- Proper error handling in place
- Clean formatting for all output
- No interference with other chat features

### Next Steps (if needed):
1. Add new monitoring features
2. Enhance existing monitors
3. Add real-time updates
4. Implement system alerts

### To Restore This State:
1. Ensure all service files are in place
2. Check display_system_info method in chat_interface.py
3. Verify system_service.py functions
4. Test each monitoring component individually
